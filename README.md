# TCCI-Abstraction
Source code for the experiments presented in a TCCI paper

Synthesis and Abstraction of Constraint Models for Hierarchical Resource Allocation Problems
==========================

This readme file explains all necessary steps to execute
experiments presented in the TCCI paper.
Please note that the experiments were actually conducted 
on a cluster with workers having 4 cores and 32 GB RAM each
so the runtime will greatly vary depending on your implementation.

However, with our efforts we hope to make it easier to validate and 
communicate our approach. 

==================================
= CAVEAT CPLEX =

As our approach highly depends on 
a working IBM ILOG CPLEX installation
you need a working version installed (tested with CPLEX 12.4)

Surely, you can nevertheless look at
all publicly availablle source code. 

-> if interested, go to http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/
   for a trial version and/or academic/student licenses
   Install and include relevant CPLEX directories to Path Variable when asked
==================================

1. Download and install eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
   (we used eclipse for Java developers 2.0, eclipse 4.3)
2. Get the source code from github
3. Import all projects into eclipse
4. Configuring the projects to work with CPLEX
   Select the project "CPLEX Model Abstraction Experiment Suite"
   a) Linux (tested with Ubuntu 13.10): 
      Open "launchers/ExperimentRunner.launch" with your favourite text editor
      Replace
      <mapEntry key="LD_LIBRARY_PATH" value="/home/alexander/Programs/CPLEX/opl/bin/x86-64_sles10_4.1"/>
      with your appropriate CPLEX path (should contain "libcplex124.so" etc.)      
   b) Windows (tested with Windows 7):
      Make sure that the environment variables CPLEX_STUDIO_BINARIES124 and CPLEX_STUDIO_DIR124 are set properly
   Run "launchers/ExperimentRunner Win.launch" or "launchers/ExperimentRunner.launch" using eclipse
5. If you see output containing "Writing /tmp/samplingAbstractionDataXYZ.dat" everything is working
6. Examine "SamplingAbstraction-Experiments/launchers" for different run configurations
	a) ParameterSweeper.launch: Starts runs based on a properties file in the "experiments/" subfolder and varying parameters and values
	b) ScalabilitySweep.launch: Is used to generate the results for centralized solutions
	
7. Upon finishing a run you can visualize the results using the ipython notebooks in  "SamplingAbstraction-Experiments/analysis/"
